#SMS Spam Detector

Welcome to the SMS Spam Detector repository! This project aims to detect spam messages in SMS using machine learning techniques.

About
This repository contains scripts and notebooks for building a spam detection model for SMS messages. The model utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify messages as either spam or not spam.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess SMS messages for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from text data for model training.
Model Training: Train machine learning models to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Usage
To get started with this project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
